# Specter - Reconnaissance and Enumeration Tool

**Specter**, is an open-source project developed and maintained by me to simplify reconnaissance and enumeration for penetration testers, red teamers, and network administrators.

## About Specter
Specter was created as a lightweight reconnaissance tool and has developed into a versatile framework. My goal with this project is to provide a comprehensive solution for recon and enumeration tasks, all while keeping the tool updated with new features and improvements. I view it as a reconnaissance framework? For me it was about bringing tools together so I didn't have to tool hop and I could easily collect my information in one place.
